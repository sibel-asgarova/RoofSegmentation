# Project Title

## Overview

This project is aimed at segmenting aerial imagery for roof segmentation. The model is designed to handle image segmentation tasks using a U-Net architecture.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sibel-asgarova/RoofSegmentation
   cd RoofSegmentation
   ```
2. **Install the required dependencies**: You can install the necessary libraries using pip or conda. Here is a sample command to install the dependencies:
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


3. **Run the main notebook**: Open and run the main.ipynb Jupyter notebook to train and test the model. You can run the notebook either in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```
